# Flappy Bird Bevy
A flappy bird clone written in Rust for the [Bevy Game Engine](https://bevyengine.org/). Created in my free-time to build upon and showcase skills related to game development and Rust programming. Bevy was chosen as it is an incredibly organized and efficient game engine utilizing the ECS paradigm. Bevy's ease-of-use and vast extendability serves as an excellent tool to combine all aspects of my programming knowledge and experience.
